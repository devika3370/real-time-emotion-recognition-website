# Real-time emotion recognition

This is a work-in-progress project. Idea is to create a website to detect emotions live. 


## Steps
- Define tasks and goals
- Literature Review
- Dataset identification + exploration - split
- Models (study -> identify which ones work the best -> implement)
- Train and evaluate the model
- Save the model
- Create basic flask app with HTML frontend
- Create a react website which can be run in a browser


## Task List
- [x] Read articles and papers about emotion recognition
- [ ] List down all the methods/architectures you want to explore
- [ ] Finalize dataset that you want to use
