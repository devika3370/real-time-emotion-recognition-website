# Real-time emotion recognition

This is a work-in-progress project. Idea is to create a website to detect emotions live. 


## Steps
0. Define tasks and goals
1. Dataset identification + exploration
2. Training/testing/validation
3. Models (study -> identify which ones work the best -> implement)
4. Train and evaluate the model
5. Save the model
6. Create basic flask app with HTML frontend
7. Create a react website which can be run in a browser
