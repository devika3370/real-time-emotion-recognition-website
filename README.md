# Real-time emotion recognition

This is a work-in-progress project. Idea is to create a website to detect emotions live. 


## Steps
0. Define tasks and goals
1. Literature Review
2. Dataset identification + exploration - split
3. Models (study -> identify which ones work the best -> implement)
4. Train and evaluate the model
5. Save the model
6. Create basic flask app with HTML frontend
7. Create a react website which can be run in a browser


## Task List
- [x] Read articles and papers about emotion recognition
- [ ] List down all the methods/architectures you want to explore
- [ ] Finalize dataset that you want to use
