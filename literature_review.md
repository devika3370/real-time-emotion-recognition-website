### Emotion Recognition using Transformers with Masked Learning
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13731 <br>
**Code:** https://github.com/msjae/ABAW <br>
**Summary:**<br>
This paper leverages the vision transformer models to focus on the estimation of Valence-arousal - which signifies the positivity and intensity of emotions, recognition of various facial features, and detection of Action Units (AU) representing fundamental muscle movements. This research includes a new training technique applied through random frame masking.
